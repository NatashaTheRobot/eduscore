        computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade,
        machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition,
        effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.
        Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of
        times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best
        way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn
        about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing
        them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you''ll learn
        about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the
        practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques
        to new problems. Finally, you''ll learn about some of Silicon Valley''s best
        practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>\n<p>This
        course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and
        statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric
        algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised
        learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep
        learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory;
        innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw
        from numerous case studies and applications, so that you''ll also learn how
        to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control),
        text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics,
        audio, database mining, and other areas.</p>","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/large-icon.png","preview_link":"https://class.coursera.org/ml/lecture/preview","small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/ml/large-icon.png","video":"e0WKJLovaZg","university-ids":["stanford"],"id":2,"universities":[{"location_city":"","location_state":"","wordmark":null,"description":"The

        href=\"http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/ang/\">Professor Andrew Ng</a>&nbsp;is
        Director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, the main AI research
        organization at Stanford, with 20 professors and about 150 students/post docs.
        At Stanford, he teaches Machine Learning, which with a typical enrollment
        of 350 Stanford students, is among the most popular classes on campus. His
        research is primarily on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics,
        and most universities doing robotics research now do so using a software platform
        (ROS) from his group.</p>\n<p>In 2008, together with SCPD he started SEE (Stanford
        Engineering Everywhere), which was Stanford''s first attempt at free, online
        distributed education. Since then, over 200,000 people have viewed his machine
        learning lectures on YouTube, and over 1,000,000 people have viewed his and
        other SEE classes'' videos.</p>\n<p>Ng is the author or co-author of over
        100 published papers in machine learning, and his work in learning, robotics
        and computer vision has been featured in a series of press releases and reviews.
        In 2008, Ng was featured in Technology Review''s TR35, a list of \"35 remarkable
        innovators under the age of 35\". In 2009, Ng also received the IJCAI Computers
        and Thought award, one of the highest honors in AI.</p>","university_logo":null,"course-ids":[16,152,970311],"display":true,"recommended_background":""}'
